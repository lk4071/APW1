		My plans for the year:
	</h3>
	<p>
			I am excited for the upcoming year. I hope to learn html using Codecademy and make an app. Last year for my final project, I made a dictionary. Originally, I wanted to make a program that allowed the user to communicate with the computer through a chat. The user would type in something, and the computer would respond. The goal of this was so that people would be able to practice learning a new language if they did not have someone at home speaking to them. This year I plan to take my work from last year and build on it. I want to accomplish my original goal and hope to make the project into an app.

		I was trying to do a part of the Codecademy course but it wouldn't let me press next. I checked my work alongside what it was asking me to do, but I couldn't find what I was doing wrong.

	I learned a lot so far! I can now add links to other pages and make them open in a new window using targets and anchors. I learned how to use images as a link too. I want to learn how to use make the images I have locally on my computer links too which is my next step. I currently have the link to get back to my main page as a text link which I want to change. I'm going to email Mr. Golanka and see if he knows how to do that so my part of the website fits my style more. I also don't like how the font looks either so I'm going learn how to change the font. I think it would be cool to change the entire background color as well as the color of my text (I want to make the text white).

	I finished the HTML course on codecademy! I'm starting to work on the CSS course now. There are a total of 8 lessons (each with many sections). I plan to complete one or two lessons by next week and have the course finished by the end of the month! I'm going to try and add things I learn from the course as I go along. I might make a page with all the versions of my pages (probably screenshots) so I can see how much it improves. I'm looking forward to partnering with Goodnews at the end of the month to build on our project from last year!

	 I started the CSS course now! I learned about how to change the fonts specifically the color, size, and type. By the end of this week I plan to have 2-3 of the lessons done.

	 I started changing the style of my website using what I learned from codecademy. The font size and colors for my home and project page have been changed to blue and purple. I've also aligined the  texts to look a bit better. I imagine that that I will be changing a few more things during bridge to make my pages more my style.
